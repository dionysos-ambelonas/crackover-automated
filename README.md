## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Bottle not found" error**
- Make sure you type the bottle name exactly as it appears in CrossOver
- Check that the bottle exists in `~/Library/Application Support/CrossOver/Bottles/`

**"No match found" in bottle**
- The bottle might already be reset or never had licensing entries
- This is normal for newly created bottles

**CrossOver still shows expired**
- Make sure all CrossOver processes were terminated before running the script
- Try running the script again
- Restart your Mac if issues persist

### Safety Features

- **Automatic Backups**: All modified files are backed up with `.bak` extensions
- **Process Verification**: Confirms CrossOver is properly closed before modifications
- **Non-Destructive**: Only removes specific licensing entries, preserves your bottle data
- **Rollback Capability**: Backups can be restored if anything goes wrong

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- **Close CrossOver First**: Always ensure CrossOver is completely closed before running
- **Regular Use**: Run weekly or when you encounter expiration messages
- **Backup Bottles**: Consider backing up important bottles before first use
- **Network**: Some users block CodeWeavers domains with firewalls (optional)
